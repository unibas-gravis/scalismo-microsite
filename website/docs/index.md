title: Scalismo tutorials
slug: /
---

The following tutorials explain all the basic concepts behind Scalismo, which are needed for developing complete shape modelling applications.
The intention behind these tutorials is not only to show how to use the software, but also to help understanding the theoretical concepts underlying the software.
Originally, these tutorials were designed as part of the Open Online Course [Statistical Shape Modelling - Computing the Human Anatomy](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/statistical-shape-modelling).
Each tutorial contains links to videos and articles from the online course, which will
provide some theoretical background.

### Preparation

There are different developement environment that you can use to program with Scala. For beginners we recommend to use *scala-cli* together with Visual Studio Code. If you are an experienced developer, who is already familiar with build systems and integrated development environments, you may want to use Scalismo from within *IntelliJ IDEA* instead.

The following guides will help you to get started with setting up your first project:
* [Using Scalismo with Scala-cli and VSCode](Setup/vscode)
* [Using Scalismo with IntelliJ IDEA (article)](Setup/ide)
* [Getting started with Scalismo in IntelliJ IDEA (Video tutorial)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3br5-Yr-h8)


### Tutorials

You will also need to [download](https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/zOJDpqh2ZGxzJJH) the datasets used in the tutorials and unzip them into your project folder.
