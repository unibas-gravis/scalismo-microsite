# Online courses

The [Graphics and Vision research group](https://gravis.dmi.unibas.ch/) of the [University of Basel](https://unibas.ch) has produced several online courses, which explain the theoretical concepts behind Scalismo and their practical application using Scalismo.  

The first course is an introductory course in statistical shape modelling. It is offered once a year as a MOOC on [FutureLearn](https://futurelearn.com/courses/statistical-shape-modelling). Its focus lies on the concept of Gaussian processes, and how these can be used to model shape variability. It also discusses simple algorithms for fitting models to surfaces and images. Outside of the official course runs, the material 
from the course can be freely accessed on the following website:

* [Statistical shape modelling](https://shapemodelling.cs.unibas.ch/ssm-course)

 
The second course focuses on probabilistic shape model fitting using a Bayesian approach. It discusses how shape model fitting can be formulated as a problem in Bayesian inference and 
how the computations can be performed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. The course is designed as a follow up to the first course. All the practical examples and tutorials
and implemented using Scalismo. 

* [Course on probabilistic fitting](https://shapemodelling.cs.unibas.ch/probabilistic-fitting-course/)

The last course covers similar ground, but is targeted at researchers in computer vision. It explains the principles of Bayesian inference and model fitting in the context of 
the problem of analyzing 2D photographs of human faces using a statistical face model.
