##### Preparation

```scala mdoc:invisible
//> using scala "2.13"
//> using lib "ch.unibas.cs.gravis::scalismo-ui:0.91-RC3"
```

As in the previous tutorials, we start by importing some commonly used objects and initializing the system.

```scala mdoc:silent
import scalismo.geometry._
import scalismo.common._
import scalismo.mesh._
import scalismo.io.{StatismoIO, StatisticalModelIO}
import scalismo.statisticalmodel._
import scalismo.ui.api._
```

```scala mdoc:invisible emptyLines:2
object Tutorial4 extends App {
```

```scala mdoc:silent emptyLines:2
scalismo.initialize()
implicit val rng: scalismo.utils.Random = scalismo.utils.Random(42)

val ui = ScalismoUI()
```



## Gaussian Processes and Point Distribution Models

We start by loading and visualizing a shape model (or PDM) of faces :

```scala mdoc:silent
val faceModel : PointDistributionModel[_3D, TriangleMesh] = StatisticalModelIO.readStatisticalTriangleMeshModel3D(new java.io.File("datasets/bfm.h5")).get
val modelGroup = ui.createGroup("model")
```

This model represents a **probability distribution of face meshes**.

While we cannot visualize this distribution directly, we can obtain
 and visualize the mean shape:
```scala mdoc:silent
val sampleGroup = ui.createGroup("samples")

val meanFace : TriangleMesh[_3D] = faceModel.mean
ui.show(sampleGroup, meanFace, "meanFace")
```
or we can obtain concrete face meshes by sampling from it:
```scala mdoc:silent
val sampledFace : TriangleMesh[_3D] = faceModel.sample()
ui.show(sampleGroup, sampledFace, "randomFace")
```


#### The GP behind the PDM:

In Scalismo, a PDM is represented as a triangle mesh (called the reference mesh)
on which a Gaussian Process over deformation fields is defined:

```scala mdoc:silent
val reference : TriangleMesh[_3D] = faceModel.reference
val faceGP : DiscreteLowRankGaussianProcess[_3D, TriangleMesh, EuclideanVector[_3D]] = faceModel.gp
```

The type signature of the GP looks slightly scary.
If we recall that a Gaussian process is a distribution over functions,
we can, however, rather easily make sense of the individual bits.
The type signature tells us that:
- It is a DiscreteGaussianProcess. This means, the function, which the process models are defined on a discrete, finite set of points.
- It is defined in 3D Space (indicated by the type parameter ```_3D```)
- Its domain of the modeled functions is a ```TriangleMesh```
- The values of the modeled functions are vectors (more precisely, they are of type ```EuclideanVector```).
- It is represented using a low-rank approximation. This is a technicality, which we will come back to later.

Consequently, when we draw samples or obtain the mean from the Gaussian process, we expect to obtain functions with a matching
signature. This is indeed the case

```scala mdoc:silent
val meanDeformation : DiscreteField[_3D, TriangleMesh, EuclideanVector[_3D]] = faceGP.mean
val sampleDeformation : DiscreteField[_3D, TriangleMesh, EuclideanVector[_3D]] = faceGP.sample()
```

Let's visualize the mean deformation:
```scala mdoc:silent
ui.show(sampleGroup, meanDeformation, "meanField")
```

* Exercise : make everything invisible in the 3D scene, except for "meanField" and "meanFace". Now zoom in (right click and drag) on the vector field. Where are the tips of the vectors ending?*

As you hopefully see, all the tips of the mean deformation vectors end on points of the mean face.

To find out where they start from, let's display the face model's reference mesh :
```tut:silent
ui.show(modelGroup, referenceFace, "referenceFace")
```

##### Exercise : Zoom in on the scene and observe the deformation field. Where are the vectors starting

As you can see, the mean deformation field of the Gaussian Process contained in our face model
is a deformation from the reference mesh of the model into the mean face mesh.

Hence when calling *faceModel.mean*, what is really happening is

1. the mean deformation field is obtained (by calling *faceModel.gp.mean*)
2. the mean deformation field is then used to deform the reference mesh (*faceModel.referenceMesh*)
into the triangle Mesh representing the mean face

The same is happening when randomly sampling from the face model :

1. a random deformation field is sampled (*faceModel.gp.sample*)
2. the deformation field is applied to the reference mesh to obtain a random face mesh


*Exercise : Perform the 2 steps above in order to sample a random face (that is sample a random deformation first, then use it to warp the reference mesh).*

ui.close()
